//! CST instead of off a token stream.
//!
//! ```text
//! &[u8] + Cst -> walk -> Facts { tag, lines, imports, symbols, vars }
//! ```
//!
//! The record is `crate::facts::Facts`, the one `pipeline` caches and `resolve`
//! reads; nothing here invents a second schema. The lexer path (`crate::parser`)
//! talks in statements and guesses where a block ends; this path knows the tree,
//! so nesting, qualified names and call arguments are facts, not inference.
//!
//! What is a definition, a call or an import is per language and written down as
//! data (`PY_DEFS`, `JS_DEFS`, `RS_DEFS`, `GO_DEFS`, `JAVA_DEFS`, ...), selected
//! by [`kinds`]; the walk itself is language neutral. Python, JavaScript,
//! TypeScript, TSX, Rust, Go, Java, C and C++ have tables, and Rust's and the
//! C family's walk arms live in their own regions below. JSON has empty tables
//! on purpose: a data file's only fact is the module symbol, so [`lang_for`]
//! answers `None` for it and the lexer path is kept. C and C++ also answer
//! `None` from `lang_for`: their tables feed `tests/facts_c_cpp.rs` and the
//! `--compare` audit, but the differential gate does not yet prefer the CST
//! record for enough real files. The other grammars fall back to the module
//! symbol until their table is written.
//!
//! Requires the `deep` and `parser` features: the Cst comes from
//! `deep_integration`, which names the runtime's kind table, and the runtime
//! (`src/deep`) is what the `parser` feature compiles.
